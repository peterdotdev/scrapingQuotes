# scrapingQuotes
Let's scrape quotes!

I took Fazt's video as a reference:

I put in practice what Fazt's has taught us, and took it one step higher.

Here we will also use puppeteer for it's click function to travel page by page.
So we can get all the quotes, its author and tags with cheerio.

Also we will save the data not only as a .csv but also as a .json file.

To run this properly you'll need to run these commands with the npm:
- npm init -y
- npm i puppeteer
- npm i cheerio
- npm i request --save
- npm i fs-extra

Hope this helps!
